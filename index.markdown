I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the [Berlin Institute of Technology](https://www.tu.berlin/en/).
My research in the [Modeling, Simulation and Optimization in Science group](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_modnumdiff/fg_modellierung_simulation_und_optimierung_in_natur_und_ingenieurswissenschaften/) focusses on high-dimensional problems and how to solve them numerically using low-rank tensor methods.
These problems arise naturally in physics, stochastics and machine learning and prominent examples are given by the Schr√∂dinger equation, uncertainty quantification and low-rank tensor completion.
I am currently working on increasing the data efficiency of solution algorithms for which I use techniques from statistical learning theory and matric completion.
My other research interests include stochastic differential equations and machine learning.
I am associated with [BIMoS](https://www.bimos.tu-berlin.de/menue/bimos/).
